/** 
  * The last warm-up task deals with a more complex component. Your goal is to design a serial receiver.
  * It scans an input line (“serial bus”) named rxd for serial transmissions of data bytes. A transmission 
  * begins with a start bit ‘0’ followed by 8 data bits. The most significant bit (MSB) is transmitted first. 
  * There is no parity bit and no stop bit. After the last data bit has been transferred a new transmission 
  * (beginning with a start bit, ‘0’) may immediately follow. If there is no new transmission the bus line 
  * goes high (‘1’, this is considered the “idle” bus signal). In this case the receiver waits until the next 
  * transmission begins. The outputs of the design are an 8-bit parallel data signal and a valid signal. 
  * The valid signal goes high (‘1’) for one clock cycle after the last serial bit has been transmitted, 
  * indicating that a new data byte is ready.
